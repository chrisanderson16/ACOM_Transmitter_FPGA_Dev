# Installing Petalinux

This process will take a long time. This should be completed after the installation of Vitis and Vivado. <br>

**NOTE:** This is not required for Vitis and Vivado development. This is only for building an operating system. Theoretically, this only needs to be done once. 
<br>
<br>
This installation guide will show a step-by-step guide on installing Petalinux. As with Vitis and Vivado, Ubuntu 22.4.3 LTS is not an officially support OS for Petalinux. <br>
Throughout my time using Petalinux, there was not a specific issue that arose from using a more current version of Ubuntu, however, it will display many warnings.
